## The Game
All of the controls and menus were designed and intended to be as clean, friendly, and initiative as possible, so if there is any confusion or need for clarification, do not hesitate to contact VeryRandomCreator
* The first screen of the game is the title screen, when can be exited by clicking anywhere.
* Dragging on the screen will cause a prediction of where the ball will go to appear, as well as the ball in the location you began the drag.
* Releasing the drag will cause the prediction to disappear and the ball to travel in that direction.
* The speed of the ball is determined by how far you dragged on the screen.
* Clicking the back button on your device will cause the options menu button to appear in the top-right corner of the app.
* The options menu contains the option to toggle sound and to change the color of the ball
* Selecting the option to toggle sound will turn the game's sound on and off, depending on the state. 
* Selecting a colored button will set the ball's current color to the one you selected. 
* Selecting the last option, the rainbow ball button, will cause the balls to spawn as different colors each time they are created.

## Final Comments
